In the code 4008-4014 lines are responsible for "Powered by Blogger" banner in the bottom.
  
  <div class='widget-content'>
    <div class='blogger'>
      <a expr:href='data:bloggerUrl' rel='nofollow'>
        <b:include name='flatBloggerIcon'/>
        <b:message name='messages.poweredByBlogger'/>
      </a>
    </div>

Also the line 55 is responsible for mentioning the name of the theme's/background's author 

  <Variable name="body.background" description="Background" type="background" color="$(body.background.color)" default="$(color) none repeat scroll top left"  value="#01050c url(https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/000/359/482/original/science-banner-chemical-laboratory-skull-books-apple-glasses-table-vector-flat-illustration.jpg) no-repeat scroll top center /* Credit: Armen-Jean Andreasian (https://github.com/Armen-Jean-Andreasian) */;"/>


  -----------
  Fun observation: 
    The lines responsible "Powered by Blogger" are written using metaprogramming, so no matter you change it or not, they will be rewritten after each request-response.
    The line of mentioning the name of the author is fully editable/removable.

  Conclusions: :)
  
  P.S. Fyi, Blogger is a part of Google.
